Note :



    First must make a dfs function to find the empty currentFrame

    must be one function that find the address so you dont need to use a global variable

    must make a function to translate the address and make each page in cell of the array


    number of the row in the table is the offest so must make a & bitwise with the part
    of the address


// Look the ex for making traverse in the tree

    must divide the address to after offset to depth tree length




Implementation :

     First : make a translate function to translate the address
        Save the address in array

    Second : use for loop to travesrs to the tree
        If the currentFrame is 0

            Must find empty currentFrame to use it

           1- Use dfs function to find currentFrame that's not in page

           2 - use evict function to find currentFrame

    use this steps for both function VMWrite and VMread
